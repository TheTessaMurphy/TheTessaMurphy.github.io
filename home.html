  <p>Welcome to my portfolio. This site is in response to an unexpected challenge and a perceived need.</p>
  <p>As a writer with over 20 years experience, primarily in technical writing and editing, I've found that most of the positions I'm attracted to require samples of my work. This presents something of a challenge, as almost everything I've written about has been proprietary and now lies behind a firewall.</p>
  <p>My primary goal with this site is to demonstrate my writing skills and experience. Although these posts are somewhat chattier than the documentation I've produced as a technical writer, they showcase what I believe to be one of my greatest strengths: the ability to distill and articulate complex technical topics clearly and simply.</p>
  <p>The subjects I write about are challenges I have encountered in my alternate existence as an aspiring web developer. So often, the information I found when I went looking for solutions was incomplete, or obscure, or even contradictory. So a secondary — but still important — goal is to help other aspiring developers by providing information that is both thorough and easily understood.</p>
  <p>That said, this is primarily a portfolio site. You can find links to my resume and linked-in profile at the bottom of this page, along with my contact information. Although the bulk of my experience has been writing and editing for engineers at a low level, I thoroughly enjoyed those times when I was writing for a higher-level audience and am open to anything.</p>
